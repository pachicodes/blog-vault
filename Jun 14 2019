I started learning to code not long ago, at sometime in October last year. That means that I have been studying for 8 months.
Now, I must confess that I often feel hopeless. 
My dream to become a developer and start working in the area feels far away and just a dream.
At the moment, I know my way around HTML and CSS pretty well and I am in the very first steps of real programming with JavaScript. 
Nothing as cool as all the code I see in my favorite TV show lol (Mr. Robot <3)
But also, a college student usually takes 4 years to graduate... 4 years!
Why in the 7 kingdoms would I believe to be ready for the market in 8 months of self-study?
